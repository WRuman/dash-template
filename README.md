#Dashboard Template
A web application template and html component set oriented towards
making "dashboards" or other information summary displays.

Layout is handled by flexbox CSS rules and the overall style is
meant to be flat or paper-like, which is still cool I think.

Expect lots of breaking changes for now and do not use it as a
UI toolkit for anything important unless you like to live 
dangerously
